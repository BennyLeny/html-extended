# HTML for Web Components Support
Current html syntax highlight doesn't color html elements with "dash" in it.  
In example, the following youtube-player element will be displayed with 2 colors instead of one:
```html
	<youtube-player id="#$5213123"></youtube-player>
```
With this HTML extended package, it will color the html element properly:

This package should work with any color scheme.
