Thanks for using the Html Extened Syntax package.

To activate Html Extended syntax, set the syntax using the Goto Anything or the View -> Syntax menu. 
To set Html Extended syntax to always open html (or others) files, follow these steps:
open an html file that has a web component in it
from the menu, select: View -> Syntax -> Open all with current extension as... -> Html Extended


---------------
Changes in 0.2.1

- fixed a bug with setting html extended to always open html files
